## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: Use the local JSON data to dynamically populate the content

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

This project really boosted my CSS skills, especially when it comes to improving my responsive designs, and my flexbox skills.

As I went along, I stumbled upon this cool gradient effect you can do in CSS:
```css
#result-box {
    background: linear-gradient(#6743ff, #2f2dea);
    /* More properties */
}
```

### Continued development

I still can implement the utilization of local JSON data for dynamic result and score updates. Additionally, I can further enhance the project's responsive design.
